SCMs Package Performance Analysis Report
========================================

Generated on: 2025-09-08 11:48:49.635327
R version: R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)

Key Findings:
- Matrix operations scale as expected with data size
- scdata preprocessing is the main bottleneck for large datasets
- scest estimation time depends heavily on constraint type
- Specification curve generation benefits significantly from parallelization

Optimization Recommendations:
1. Implement data.table optimizations in scdata preprocessing
2. Add matrix caching for repeated computations
3. Optimize CVXR solver selection based on problem characteristics
4. Implement memory-efficient specification curve storage
