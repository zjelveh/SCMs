\title{Calculate Cross-Specification P-values for Filtered Results}
\usage{
calculate_spec_curve_pvalues_filtered(
  filtered_results,
  abadie_inference = NULL,
  expected_direction = "negative",
  name_treated_unit = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filtered_results}{Data.table. Filtered results data (post-filtering by outcomes, RMSE, etc.)}

\item{abadie_inference}{List. Abadie inference results from original spec_curve output}

\item{expected_direction}{Character. Expected direction of treatment effect: "negative", "positive", or "two_sided"}

\item{name_treated_unit}{Character. Name of the treated unit for filtering inference results}
}
\value{
List containing specification curve p-values:
\itemize{
\item median_tau_pvalues: P-values based on median treatment effect across filtered specifications
\item stouffer_pvalues: P-values based on average Z-score across filtered specifications (Stouffer's method)
}
}
\description{
Calculates specification curve-level p-values by aggregating treatment effects
across filtered specifications and ranking units. Implements two test statistics:
\enumerate{
\item Median treatment effect across specifications, 2) Average Z-score (Stouffer's method).
This function operates on the filtered data that will actually be plotted.

\details{
Calculate Specification Curve P-values on Filtered Data

This function calculates p-values on the subset of data that will actually be visualized,
ensuring that the statistical inference matches the displayed results. Key features:
\itemize{
\item Works on filtered data (by RMSE threshold, outcomes, etc.)
\item Calculates median treatment effect for each unit across filtered specifications only
\item Converts individual specification p-values to Z-scores and averages them
\item Ranks all units based on filtered results and assigns p-values
\item Accounts for expected direction when ranking (negative vs positive effects)
