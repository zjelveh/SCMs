\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame containing the panel data.}

\item{outcome}{Character. Name of the outcome variable (column in dataset).}

\item{covagg}{List of covariates used for matching (columns in dataset).}

\item{col_name_unit_name}{Character. Column name in dataset containing unit names (e.g., state names).}

\item{name_treated_unit}{Character. Name of the treated unit (e.g., the state that received treatment).}

\item{col_name_period}{Character. Column name in dataset containing time periods.}

\item{treated_period}{Numeric. Time period when treatment starts for the treated unit.}

\item{min_period}{Numeric. Earliest time period in the dataset.}

\item{end_period}{Numeric. Latest time period in the dataset.}

\item{outcome_models}{Character vector. Outcome models to fit. Default is c("none", "ols", "ridge", "lasso", "augsynth").}

\item{feature_weights}{Character. Method for assigning weights to predictors ("uniform" or "optimize"). Default is "uniform".}

\item{w.constr}{Optional. Constraints on the weights.}

\item{V}{Character. Covariance matrix estimation method. Default is "separate".}

\item{V.mat}{Optional. Pre-computed covariance matrix.}

\item{solver}{Character. Solver to use for the optimization problem. Default is "ECOS".}

\item{constant}{Logical. Whether to include a constant term in synthetic control weights. Default is FALSE.}

\item{P}{Optional. Number of factors to use (for AugSynth).}
