\usage{
extract_panel_b(
  plot_spec_curve_result,
  file_path = NULL,
  width = 8,
  height = 8,
  legend_position = "right"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot_spec_curve_result}{List. Result object from plot_spec_curve().}

\item{file_path}{Character or NULL. File path to save the plot. If NULL, plot is not saved.}

\item{width}{Numeric. Width of the saved plot in inches. Default is 8.}

\item{height}{Numeric. Height of the saved plot in inches. Default is 8.}

\item{legend_position}{Character. Position of the legend: "right" (default), "left", "bottom", "top", or "none".}
}
\value{
ggplot object for Panel B (specification features/SHAP).
}
\description{
Extracts Panel B (specification features and SHAP values plot) from
plot_spec_curve results and optionally saves it to a file. Useful for presentations
where you want to focus on the specification details without the treatment effects.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate specification curve with SHAP
spec_result <- plot_spec_curve(data, name_treated_unit = "Philadelphia", show_shap = TRUE)

# Show only Panel B (legend on right by default)
panel_b_plot <- extract_panel_b(spec_result)

# Save Panel B with legend on bottom for presentations
extract_panel_b(spec_result, file_path = "specification_features.png", 
                width = 10, height = 8, legend_position = "bottom")
                
# Save Panel B with no legend for clean slides

                width = 10, height = 8, legend_position = "none")
