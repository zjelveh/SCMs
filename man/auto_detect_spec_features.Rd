\title{Automatically Detect Specification Features with Variation}
\usage{
auto_detect_spec_features(
  data,
  treated_unit_name,
  outcome_filter = NULL,
  include_features = NULL,
  exclude_features = NULL,
  min_unique_values = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data.table. Long format specification curve data.}

\item{treated_unit_name}{Character. Name of the treated unit.}

\item{outcome_filter}{Character. Optional outcome filter.}

\item{include_features}{Character vector. Features to always include if they exist.}

\item{exclude_features}{Character vector. Features to always exclude.}

\item{min_unique_values}{Integer. Minimum unique values required.}
}
\value{
Character vector of feature names with variation.
}
\description{
Analyzes the data to identify SPECIFICATION features that have more
than one unique value within the treated unit, suitable for SHAP analysis.
Automatically excludes performance metrics (rmse, r_squared, etc.) and focuses
only on features that define how the synthetic control was constructed.
