### **1.1 The Garden of Forking Paths in Synthetic Control Methods**
- Researcher degrees of freedom in SC implementation:
  - Donor pool selection (all units vs. similarity-based filtering)
  - Covariate specifications (which variables, aggregation methods)
  - Weight constraints (simplex, lasso, ridge, OLS)
  - Feature weighting approaches (uniform vs. optimized)

- How these choices can dramatically impact results
- Current practice: ad-hoc sensitivity analysis

## **2. Methodology** (4-5 pages)

### **2.1 Specification Curve Analysis Framework**
- Formal definition of specification space for synthetic controls
- Mathematical notation for specification parameters:
  - $\mathcal{S} = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_K\}$ (specification set)
  - $\tau_s$ (treatment effect under specification $s$)
  - $\Theta = \{\tau_{s_1}, \tau_{s_2}, \ldots, \tau_{s_K}\}$ (effect distribution)

### **2.2 Synthetic Control Specification Dimensions**
- **Donor Pool Selection**: $D \in \{\text{all}, \text{most_similar}\}$
- **Covariate Specifications**: $C \in \{\text{baseline}, \text{extended}, \text{minimal}\}$
- **Weight Constraints**: $W \in \{\text{simplex}, \text{lasso}, \text{ridge}, \text{ols}\}$
- **Feature Weighting**: $V \in \{\text{uniform}, \text{optimized}\}$
- **Outcome Models**: $M \in \{\text{none}, \text{augsynth}, \text{ridge}, \text{lasso}\}$

### **2.3 SHAP-Based Specification Interpretation**
- **The prediction problem setup**:
  - **Target variable**: $\tau_s$ (treatment effect for specification $s$)
  - **Feature matrix**: $X_s$ (specification characteristics)
  - **Prediction model**: $f(X_s) \approx \tau_s$
- **SHAP value computation**:
  - $\phi_j(s) = $ SHAP value for feature $j$ in specification $s$
  - $\tau_s = \phi_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j(s)$ (additive decomposition)
- **Interpretation**:
  - $\phi_j(s) > 0$: Feature $j$ increases treatment effect estimate
  - $\phi_j(s) < 0$: Feature $j$ decreases treatment effect estimate
  - $|\phi_j(s)|$: Magnitude of feature $j$'s contribution
- **Visualization integration**: Specification curves colored by SHAP values

### **2.4 Design-Based Inference Framework**
- **Placebo-based inference**: 
  - Multiple test statistics: RMSE ratio, treatment effect, normalized treatment effect
  - Two-sided p-values: $p = 2 \times \min(\text{upper_tail}, \text{lower_tail})$
  - Accounting for correlation between specifications
- **Bootstrap inference**: 
  - Null hypothesis testing under no-treatment assumption
  - Specification-level p-values
- **Joint inference**: Combining evidence across specifications
